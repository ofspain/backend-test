Since the algorithm uses an out for loop that makes call to various nested loop
with some of the nested loop themselves nesting some other loop.
The classification of the algorithm used based on the loop nesting is thus

a) Parent outer loop.....O(n) n depends on the lenght of the array
b) Immediate nested loop....O(C) is is a constant of 30000(Possible range of values in array)
c) Next nested loop......O(C) as in b above

The other three nested loop are O(v) where variable that depends on the maxmium
       lenght of bit representation of values of 15 lenght, this becomes O(15)

The final big(O) value is thus O(n^c*c + 15)
